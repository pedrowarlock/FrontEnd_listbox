Visual Basic 6 - GPP v1.4 Demo
==============================

This VB program demonstrates the features of Michael Koch GPP Proxy DLL v1.4.


Installation
------------
To test this with a DirectX 9.0c program, you will need to copy the "D3D9.DLL" and "D3DX9_27.DLL" files from the "GPP_1.4" folder into the main program folder.

NOTE: DO NOT copy the "D3D9.DLL" into the "C:\Windows\System32" otherwise it will overwrite the original DX9 DLL.


Using the program
-----------------

By launching the program you will be presented with one button and a label.

Every second the program will check for the DirectX screen size.
If the screen size is found this will be shown in the label, and the timer will stop.
If the screen size is not found, a "N/A" message is display.

By clicking on the button, single line text, multi-line text, FPS, and a picture will be shown in the DirectX screen.
